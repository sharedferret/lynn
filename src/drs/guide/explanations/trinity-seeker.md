## Important Information

* **Fourfold Mercy**: This attack works similarly to normal mode, with four half-room cleaves at a diagonal. The Savage version happens faster and without ground markers. Safe spots will be called using the waymarks, for example "1 3 4 2". If possible, this will be simplified, e.g. "North for 2, South for 2". Stay inside the boss's hitbox when dodging, you won't have enough time to make it all the way out to the waymarks. Later in the fight, a clone of Seeker will spawn at a corner of the arena, and then do a Fourfold Mercy. The safe spots will be called using waymarks, but additionally using a "blank" waymark. For example, a South clone with a crossover pattern might be called "4 C 3 Blank".

* **Ifrit Dashes**: This is a new mechanic in the Savage version of the fight. Adds will spawn at the edge of the arena and cleave the middle of the arena with AOEs. Get behind the first AOE and rotate behind the AOEs.

* If the main tank dies, call out in Yell or voice chat. Any tank can turn on stance and provoke the boss at that point.

* If all the healers in your party die, mark one of them with a Chain symbol and call out in yell chat. Healers should prioritize Arising that healer.

## Other Explanations

* Make sure everyone except the Main Tank has stance off - other tanks may still have their tank stance on from the doorboss encounters.

* Remind the raid to use food, potions, and their Lost Actions. Damage-increasing actions should be used on pull and during each 2-minute burst.

## Roles Needed

* **Main Tank**
  * The main tank will need to point the boss in a cardinal direction (preferably North) as much as possible to make Baleful Swathe and Act of Mercy easier to dodge. The boss jumps to the middle of the arena frequently, so don't worry about pulling the boss back to the center.
  
## Waymarks

(Waymark image here)

* Fourfold Mercy: Call the safe quadrants in order. For Seeker this will be the 1/2/3/4 waymarks. For the clones, this will the be waymarks closest to the clone, including a "blank" waymark at one corner.

* Ifrit Dashes: Call the closest safe spot to the first dash (A, B, C, or D), and then call which barricade the raid should end up in front of or behind (usually 1, 2, 3, or 4, but can also be letters depending on if you want the raid to end up on a specific side of a barricade).

## Caller Tips

* For **Seasons of Mercy**, call the safe direction from the gaze first (look away from 1), then call the safe direction from the flower (go towards 4).

* For the first set of Ifrit dashes, you can typically hide behind the next barricade from where you start. Call this early to minimize the number of people who try to rush to the following barricade and get knocked into the death wall.

* Keep an eye on the boss’s HP. You might push the boss if it reaches 79% before the first Baleful Swathe, 59% before the first Iron Impact, or 44% before the first Act of Mercy. If you phase push, call the next phase transition attack immediately.

* After the final clone Fourfold Mercy + knockback/hide, you’ll see a solo or group tankbuster, possibly prefaced with a Phantom Edge. After this tankbuster, you’ll see one more Verdant Path phase change attack if you pushed the boss earlier in the fight.

* **Healer LB3 timing**: After the first clone Fourfold Mercy. Call for LB3 after breaking chains.
