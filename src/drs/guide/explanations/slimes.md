## Important Information

* **Goal**
  * The goal for Slime side is to build large green slimes in each of the four rooms, then have them fuse together on the green pads in the center of each room at the same time.
  * Green slimes (Viscous Clots) spawn three at a time in the middle of the hallway. One red slime (Sanguine Clot) will spawn in each of the four rooms repeatedly.
  * To build the green slimes, we have our marked room tanks pull green slimes from the hallway, then have them fuse in their rooms. After each room tank is holding a slime made of 5 small slimes (that is, their slime has a +4 buff), our room healers will pull one green slime each and take them to the inner edge corner of their room. When everyone's ready, tanks will provoke their healer's slime to create the large green slimes.

* **Marked Tanks**: If you're a marked tank, turn your tank stance on. You'll pull slimes with your ranged attack, then have them fuse in your room near the pad. When your slime has a +4 buff, move it to the center of the pad in your room. You'll target the healer's slime and provoke when the caller says to. After your slime begins casting "Fusion" (and then "Rupture"), you can run out of the room.

* **Marked Healers**: Keep your tank healed up - only use normal healing spells, not HoTs (this encounter can easily fail by accidentally changing the enmity list). When instructed by the caller, run into the hallway and grab one slime with a standard GCD. Bring it to the inside corner of your room near the hallway entrance or exit, then hold it until your tank provokes it off you.

* **North/South Adds (A/C)**: Bozjan Soldiers will spawn at the north and south ends of the hallway. Pick these up when they spawn, and face them out towards the entrance/exit. The cast Hellish Slash can be stunned or slept.

* **Everyone Else**: Pick up the red Sanguine Clots when they spawn. Take them to the outer corner of your room and kill them.

* **Traps**: There are three traps on Slime side. One bomb trap will always be in the middle of the hallway. One room will contain a bomb trap, and one room will contain a poison trap. A Perceptor can pre-percept to determine where the room traps are, by using Lost Perception at the far left of the beginning hallway (near room 3) and on the other side of the wall from room 4 - this will tell the Perceptor if a trap is in room 3 or 4, and if a trap is in room 1/2 (if a trap is in a north room, the Perceptor will not know which room it's in ahead of the pull). These traps need to be percepted before it is safe for people to enter trapped rooms. However, since the traps always spawn to the left or right of the pad, players can enter an unpercepted room if they hug the walls.

* **Clear Condition**: When all four large green slimes begin casting Rupture, one person should /shout "Fusing" so that people on Golem side know to finish their encounter. Everyone should run out the north exit of the hallway and go as far as you can to the northeast corner of the area.

## Other Explanations

* When two slimes (of any color) get close to each other, they will cast Fusion and attempt to fuse together. Two green slimes will create a larger green slime. A red slime and any other slime will create a larger red slime. Any red slime that has fused with another slime is dangerous enough to cause a wipe. (Non-marked) Tanks and ranged players can Interject the Fusion cast to prevent this from occurring.
* If the large green slimes cast Rupture off of the green pad ("off the pad" means the center of the slime is outside of the pad), or of the slimes cast Rupture more than 10 seconds apart from each other, the encounter will fail.
* If a wipe is called from either side, everyone will need to die in order to reset the instance. Use any remaining bomb traps, large slimes, and soldiers to accomplish this.

## Roles Needed

* **4x Marked Tanks**: One tank per room. Mark these tanks with the **1**, **2**, **3**, and **4** symbols. Tank 1 can invuln the trap in the middle of the hallway if they want - please inform the raid if doing this.

* **4x Marked Healers**: One healer per room. Mark these healers with the **◻**, **○**, **+**, and **△** symbols.

* **2x DPS for adds**: One at A and one at C.

* **1x Perceptor**: A player carrying Lost Perception. Typically, this will be the Duelist, who will carry Lost Perception and Lost Excellence through Trinity Seeker. This player will use Lost Perception to unveil the traps in the hallway and rooms.

## Waymarks

![](/assets/drs/slimes-waymark-1.png) ![](/assets/drs/slimes-waymark-2.png)

* The first set of waymarks is to assign players to rooms. Each numbered waymark/room should have one tank (marked with a number) and one healer (marked with a shape), along with at least 2 DPS. Assign one player each to A and C to handle the Bozjan Soldier adds.
* The second set of waymarks shows the rooms (1, 2, 3, and 4), and a C marker where new slimes drop.


## Caller Tips

* Use /shout to inform Golem side when you've finished explanations. When both sides are ready, start a 20 second countdown.
* On pull, have everyone go to their assigned room. The trap in the hallway can be percepted or invulned - keep the raid a safe distance away until the hallway trap is dealt with.
* Call for tanks to pull slimes, one at a time. The first time each tank goes out, they should pick up 3 slimes. The second time each tank goes out, they should pick up 2 slimes.
* Once tanks have the slimes they need, call for healers to go into the hallway to pick up one slime each. At this point, you can click on each room's slime to make sure it has a +4 buff. If not, instruct that room's tank to pick up extra slimes to fix it. Ask for tanks to use /yell or voice chat to let you know when their room is ready.
* Once all rooms are ready, call for tanks to provoke the final slime off their healers. Check that all four slimes are fusing and are on the middle of their pads. The slimes will gain a slowing effect when they cast Rupture. When this happens, call for everyone to run to the northeast corner of the area, taking any remaining adds with them. Call "Fusing" in shout chat to let Golem side know your side is done. You'll know your side was done correctly if all of the slimes disappear after all four large slimes explode.
