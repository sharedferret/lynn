Cure IV interacts with your Pure essence to apply a 10% bravery damage boost to your party. You can also use Cure IV to heal the party when your healers are busy (for example, using LB3) or dead.\nYour pre-pop bag has three options for a damage action alongside Cure IV. For first-timers, Chainspell is the easiest action of the three to use. Lost Font of Magic is the preferred action for Black Mages, and for casters that want to deal extra damage. Resistance Ether Kits are required for non-BLMs carrying Lost Font of Magic. Banner of Honored Sacrifice is an option for Red Mages, since your burst phase is mixed physical/magic damage.\nC4 Casters are also tasked with applying Shell II (and Bubble, if someone in the raid needs it) throughout the raid. If you’re assigned as Shell II for a fight in the roster, you’ll need to apply Shell II to players before we pull that boss. After applying Shell II, you can slot over it with Cure IV.\nLight Curtains are for the Queen’s Sovereignty mechanic, where players must reflect orbs to create a safe spot.

It is best to check your roster and see what extra actions you should bring along with you need with you (Dispel/Reflect). Steelsting can also be replaced by Spellforge as well as vice versa. Another good pointer is to shove as many arises as you can into your bag once you're done setting up the rest of your bag.\n\nChainspell is honestly a better option over Font of Magic for healers. Chainspell can be carried through most of the instance without much trouble with using a fresh single plate. As well as not being MP intensive as Font of Magic can be. Just make sure to be using Lucid on CD!\n\nIf you are assigned reflect, you can either bring the Lost Reflect action or bring 8-10 Light Curtain items. They do the same thing but the main trade-off is that Light Curtains do not take an action slot. This is for people who are comfortable taking their reflect orbs and can ration them well.\n\nA second Seraph Strike is brought in case of needing to overwrite it. Healers should try to have a DPS action at all times to help DPS, but sometimes there are moments where needing double support actions is necessary to help the party/raid.",

If in doubt, just bring 2 Lost Reflects and don't worry about it.\n- The Lost Cure III should be used going into Queen soft enrage. Use in conjunction with Lost Cure IV (Lost Cure III is a GCD heal, Lost Cure IV is oGCD)\n- A sole caster in a party running Lost Cure IV for bravery is not \"also a pseudohealer\", their Cure IVs are specifically for buffing the party with 1-minute 10% Bravery.",
