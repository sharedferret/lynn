# DRS Anyprog Essential Information

Welcome! This page contains all of the information you need to know ahead of time for a Delubrum
Reginae Savage anyprog run on THL.

While DRS is not as difficult as it was on launch, it is still high level content. The raid’s ability
to clear relies on everyone bringing the correct actions and respecting the content. If this is your
first time attempting DRS, please read **all** of the sections below. I know it’s a lot to read, but
it’ll help both you and your party succeed in DRS.

## Requirements

Anyprogs are a one-time run where anyone can sign up and participate. It doesn’t matter if you’ve
never set foot in DRS before or if you have 100 clears, you’re welcome on the run. There’s a few
things you’ll need to do before the run, though:

* Have Delubrum Reginae (Savage) unlocked.
* Complete the Let Me Holster That For You quest from Kriv in Gangos.
* Look up your role’s holster at [https://forays.info/drs/holster](https://lynn.pet/drs/holster) (Lynn Kaneko - Anyprog or Anyprog Chaining).
* Get enough Resistance Reraisers, Pure Essences, and Lost Actions for 4 pulls.

<alert severity="warning">If you don’t have a Pure Essence or Resistance Reraiser equipped at the start of a pull, you will be asked to leave the run. Please bring enough Essences and Reraisers for 4 pulls, as we will not be waiting between pulls for people to grab more off the market board.</Alert>

If you’d like, you can do a few more things to prepare:

* Separate your Debuff Bar and make it large enough to easily see. You will be relying on reading your debuffs for several mechanics in DRS.
* Practice any Lost Actions you’re unfamiliar with in BSF or Gangos.
* Practice the [Trinity Avowed Swords mechanic](https://drshelper.github.io/ta).
* Check out one of the guides on DRS:
  * [Infographic Guide (WIP)](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1MMFZsMq9LV1JXG-eEqqor0q1BYlWvYCi)

## Party Roles

Every party needs people running several different roles in order to succeed. Each party requires at least one tank, one healer, one caster running Lost Cure IV, one physical ranged player running Lost Dervish, and one melee.

* Tank (1 required): One tank in each party needs to bring Lost Aethershield. This action is used on Trinity Avowed and The Queen to mitigate the effects of those bosses’ raidwides.
* Healer (1 required, 2 preferred): Healers are responsible for bringing Lost Spellforge and Lost Steelsting. These actions are used on Queen’s Guard to allow the party to deal damage during a certain mechanic. Healers are also responsible for using a Healer LB3 near the end of each boss fight to resurrect players who have died during the encounter. They can also use Lost Arise after each encounter to resurrect players, or during the encounter to resurrect other healers.
* Caster (1 required): One caster in each party needs to bring Lost Cure IV (C4). Casters using Pure Essence of the Elder have a hidden interaction with Lost Cure IV that gives the party a 10% Bravery (damage) buff every time it is used - casters should be using C4 at least once every 60 seconds to keep the buff on their party. This action is also the most potent healing spell in DRS - casters can use Cure IV to quickly heal the party after raidwides.
* Physical Ranged (1 required): One physical ranged player in each party needs to bring Lost Dervish. This action gives a number of DPS buffs to their party for 60 seconds. This action should be used on pull and during every 2-minute burst window. If a party has two ranged players, they can alternate using Dervish to get 100% uptime.
* Melee (1 required): These are the main damage dealers of the party.

## Raid Roles

There are a few required roles needed for the raid to succeed:

* Duelist (1, any job): The Duelist will have an additional 1v1 encounter after Trinity Seeker. If they succeed, they gain the Pride of the Lioness buff, which gives a major buff to all of their stats.
* Lost Flare Star (1, BLM): Lost Flare Star is an action that applies a massive DoT to an enemy. Since only one instance of LFS can be applied to an enemy at one time, we assign one player to run LFS for the instance. LFS is best used by Black Mages.
* Percepts (4-5, DPS): These players will sweep for traps using the Lost Perception action. There are traps during the Slimes and Golems doorboss encounters, after Trinity Seeker, after the Bozjan Phantom, and after Trinity Avowed. Usually, the Duelist is responsible for percepting after Seeker, and tanks will use their invuln to pop traps after Trinity Avowed.
* Rend (2, Melee): Lost Rend Armor is an action that applies a 10% damage vulnerability to enemies for 30 seconds. In order to keep 100% uptime on the Rend Armor debuff, the raid has two players assigned to bring Rend, with an order (1 or 2). Those players will alternate using Rend to keep the debuff on the boss.
* Banish (1 + backup, Healer): Lost Banish III is used during the Bozjan Phantom encounter to keep a 25% damage vulnerability debuff on the boss.
* QG Dispel (1 + backup, Tank): Lost Dispel is used during the first phase of Queen’s Guard to dispel the Boost buff that the Queen’s Warrior applies to itself.
* Melee Excellence Battery (1-3, optional): Lost Excellence is an action that greatly increases the amount of damage a player does for the first 60 seconds of a fight. Unfortunately, it’s 25 weight, making it difficult to bring on its own. To get around this, we assign 1-3 players to bring Lost Excellence and act as a battery. At their assigned boss, they’ll slot Lost Excellence alongside their Lost Font of Power. Other players who want to use Excellence will slot a Mimic action, target the battery, and use Mimic to copy the Font of Power and Excellence to their action bar.
* Caster Excellence Battery (1-3, optional): See Melee Excellence Battery. These players will instead slot Lost Excellence alongside their Lost Font of Magic.

You can sign up for Lost Flare Star, Rend, and Banish through the Raid Helper signups. There will be a post below the signups on THL to sign up for Excellence Batteries or Duelist.

## Holsters

In order for the raid to succeed, everyone needs to bring effective actions, the correct essence, and a Resistance Reraiser. Pure Essences and Resistance Reraisers are required for every pull. If you don’t have a Pure and Reraiser equipped, you’ll be asked to leave the instance until you can get them. Please bring enough Pures and Reraisers for 4 pulls, so that we don’t have to wait between pulls. Vets are allowed to run different holsters if they’d like - just let the raid lead know if you’re planning to use a non-Pure Essence.

You can find your job’s holster at [https://lynn.pet/drs/holster](https://lynn.pet/drs/holster) - select Lynn Kaneko, and then Anyprog or Anyprog (Mimic Chaining). The site will show two loadouts - Pre-DRS and Main. The Pre-DRS holster is what you should grab at the box in Gangos before zoning in. This loadout will contain a Pure Essence, Resistance Reraiser, and two Lost Actions. If your Pre-DRS holster has more than two actions, read the explanation to see which two you need to bring. You’ll equip your Main Holster at the box after zoning in.

Offensive Lost Actions (such as Lost Font of Power/Magic, Chainspell, and Banner of Honored Sacrifice) should be used on pull, and during every 2-minute burst window after that.
